# AttentionEEG

## Expeirment Description

This is an attention-related experiment in which you are required to respond when you have detected a stimulus with 
specific features. There are two objects in this experiment (i.e., circle and square), that could appear with two different 
color (i.e., red and blue). 
This experiment involves 20 blocks, each containing 50 stimuli. In each stimulus, you would see two flashes. In the first 
flash, a specific shape appears with a specific color. In the second flash, the object moves either to left or to right. 
Thus, as you can imagine, the object has a spatial feature (movement to left or right) and two semantic feature (shape and color)
In the beginning of each block, you would be asked to attend to specific movement (either left or right) and a specific semantic 
feature (either shape or color). For instance, if you are asked to attend to shape, and attend to circle going to left; you would 
only care about circles that moved to left (w.r.t to first flash). Note that in this case you are only asked about the shape, hence, you should ignore the color and ONLY attend to shape. On the other hand, if you are asked about color, you should ignore shape.
